# Shorthand.VSAddins.JsonVisualizer
This is just a code-dump of my old JsonVisualizer for Visual Studio 2013 and earlier. Visual Studio got a built-in visualizer for JSON
in Visual Studio 2015 so this should be pretty obsolete by now but I keep getting questions about it for some reason.


The addin is available at
[the Visual Studio Markerplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Karl-JohanSjogrenShorthandSoftware.ShorthandJsonVisualizer)
if you do not want to compile it yourself.
